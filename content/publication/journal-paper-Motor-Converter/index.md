abstract: With the development of high-temperature wide bandgap power semiconductors, such as SiC MOSFET and GaN HEMT, it becomes possible to integrate the power converter directly into motors. However, the leakage magnetic flux in the motor may cause interference with the operation of the electronic circuit. In this article, the electromagnetic compatibility of the power converter integrated in an induction motor is investigated. The simulation shows that the leakage magnetic flux of the end-winding will penetrate into the nearby area, and it will cause interference with the Hall-effect current sensors if the power converter is mounted in the space between the motor end cap and the end-winding. A prototype of the GaN-HEMT-based power converter is built and integrated into a 3-hp induction motor. The leakage magnetic flux is scanned by the linear Hall-effect sensors and the measured result is aligned with the finite-element simulation.
