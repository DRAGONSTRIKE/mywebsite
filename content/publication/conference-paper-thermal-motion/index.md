abstract: This study presents a novel method for creating moving thermal sensations by integrating the thermal referral illusion with tactile motion. Conducted through three experiments on human forearms, the first experiment examined the impact of temperature and thermal actuator placement on perceived thermal motion, finding the clearest perception with a centrally positioned actuator under both hot and cold conditions. The second experiment identified the speed thresholds of perceived thermal motion, revealing a wider detectable range in hot conditions (1.8 cm/s to 9.5cm/s) compared to cold conditions (2.4cm/s to 5.0cm/s). Finally, we integrated our approach into virtual reality (VR) to assess its feasibility through two interaction scenarios. Our results shed light on the comprehension of thermal perception and its integration with tactile cues, promising significant advancements in incorporating thermal motion into diverse thermal interfaces for immersive VR experiences.
